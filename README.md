I started to learning some robotic stuff for my high school projects on 3th grade. One of this projects is a Lego NXT robot.
The main Lego NXT's coding is based on blocks, this means that the coding is limited.
So, I decide to learn C, and I found a way to code for NXT using "C" (because is not exacly C, but still works).
The softwere that I use is Bricx CC for run and commit the code on the NXT brick, but i use VS Code for a better 
experience to programming, because Im very used to the interface.
